# *Pseudo Code*

GROUP PROJECT

This pseudocode was completed in collaboration.
Collaborators: Kapil, Ishmam and Dairon.
Date: 19th Sept 2023.

```javascript
Important to take the time to consider how the website will work from multiple perspectives.
How will the user interact with the website, what do they need to see, understand and what do we expect them to do.
Then with that understanding, what do I as a Front End developer need to complete on a high level, in order to achieve that.
Subsequently, what programming tools, concepts, functions etc. do I need to use to achieve that, and can I start coding out a bit under each point.
I can review the past week(s) material to get a clue on how to code the initial bits.

## USER VIEW OF PAGE
- consider how the images show up on the cards, and if we will use all the same cards. Or a mixture of top/mid/bottom.
- what color scheme are we going for in terms of the look and feel of the website?
-<b><i> What is this project's user story? and acceptance criteria</b></i>
- When the user accesses the website they will see different elements on the page. How much will be seen initially on the page?#
- Overall the webpage will have:
1. Navbar (Homepage|Contact us | Jumbotron/ Main Heading)
2. Bootstrap cards (Disabling cards once a user has selected them)
3. Footer contact
4. Images
5. what color scheme should we implement, and why?
   
- <b><u>(OUTPUTs from this stage: wireframe(s) of the website to be built, with relevant elements incorporated e.g. color, size of items on display etc.)</b></u>

## DEVELOPER TASKS

- ensure that website works on different screen sizes (media query)
- how does the styling of the design look like once you change size of the webpage.
- Test if user presses back rather then using the button or copies the initial link, where does it take them)
- read the bootstrap documentation, the google api documentation and the wikipedia documentation
- create repository, with initial files and folder structure
- ensure that required script links are in html to script.js and style.css, reset.css
- we need to use gitignore to hide the api keys, and create accounts for both APIs google and wikipedia
- the api keys go into the config.js file.
- we need to build either 1 page with multi lines of code, or up to 9 pages 
- is it useful to have a timer on the link
-  Counter to keep track of how many card you have left
-  Once a user refreshed the page, the card is either hidden or disabled and moved to the bottom of the lsit. Whilst the unseen cards come to the top)
-

(OUTPUT stage 2: logic behind all the elements needed)

## FUNCTIONs,TOOLS etc NEEDED TO EXECUTE

(OUPUT stage 3: build the html, javascript, asset folder etc., review online documents, code and test along the way. Remember to commit each time you have working code. Make use of alert, confirm, prompt and console.log when testing but change to show elements on the page.)

- 2 Api's (Google Aerial view/ Wikipedia)
