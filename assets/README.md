## Module 9: Project 1 Week 1

Welcome to your first group project! This is an important step in your journey to become a front-end developer, as you will now use your newly acquired skills and knowledge to build a web application from scratch. With your team, you'll conceive and execute a design that solves a real-world problem by integrating data received from multiple server-side API requests.

Because you'll be working collaboratively, you'll learn agile development methodologies and implement feature and bug fixes using Git branch workflow and pull requests.

### Roadmap

Let's explore what you'll learn and accomplish in the upcoming module.

**What You Will Learn:**

This week, you'll learn how to do the following:

- Speak technically about a feature you implemented in your project.
- Explain and execute Git branching workflow in a collaborative project.
- Resolve merge conflicts.
- Explain agile software development.
- Design, build, and deploy a client-side web application using GitHub Pages.
- Prepare a professional presentation and repository README for your project.

### Project 1: Interactive Front-End Application

At the conclusion of each phase of this course, you’ll work with a group of your fellow students to create a project—collaborative work among a group of developers to create an application that solves a real-world problem. Projects model the experience you’ll encounter in every development role at any company, from large multinational businesses to small startups. Coding is collaborative.

A project is a bit different from the Challenge assignments you’ve worked on so far. One of the biggest differences is that you’ll no longer build an application by yourself! This has some advantages—you won’t have to do all of the work, you can divide up duties, and you can share skills and knowledge with other developers and rely on their strengths. Yet this can also be challenging if you’re used to working alone. Constant communication and time management are just two of the skills you’ll need to practice to make sure everyone in your group works together to complete the project.

You won't receive a user story or acceptance criteria for your projects, because you and your group will create them once you decide which real-world problem your application will solve. This lack of constraints can be freeing in a way, because you have room to build what you want, but it also means that you have to decide what those constraints are before you can start working.

Finally, a project requires a presentation because you’re trying to convince an audience that it serves a purpose. Your instructional staff and fellow students are investors, and you’re pitching your creation to them—an experience that developers are required to do frequently. Your presentation is just as important as the actual project, so take it just as seriously.

### Project Requirements

With your team, you'll conceive and execute a design that solves a real-world problem by integrating data received from multiple server-side API requests. You'll also learn about agile development methodologies to help you work collaboratively. You'll implement feature and bug fixes using Git branch workflow and pull requests.

You'll write your own user stories and acceptance criteria in GitHub Issues to help your team stay on track with the project. Using GitHub Project to track the status of your project tasks will help you understand the benefits of Kanban boards.

You and your group will use everything you’ve learned over the past six modules to create a real-world front-end application that you’ll be able to showcase to potential employers. The user story and acceptance criteria will depend on the project that you create, but your project must fulfill the following requirements:

- Use Bootstrap.
- Be deployed to GitHub Pages.
- Be interactive (in other words, accept and respond to user input).
- Use at least two server-side APIs.
- Use modals instead of alerts, confirms, or prompts.
- Use client-side storage to store persistent data.
- Be responsive.
- Have a polished UI.
- Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, and so on).
- Have a quality README (including a unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to the deployed application).

### Presentation Requirements

Use this [Project Presentation Template](#) to address the following:

- Elevator pitch: A one-minute description of your application.
- Concept: What is your user story? What was your motivation for development?
- Process: What were the technologies used? How were tasks and roles broken down and assigned? What challenges did you encounter? What were your successes?
- Demo: Show your stuff!
- Directions for future development.
- Links to the deployed application and the GitHub repository.

### Grading Requirements

## How to Submit Your Interactive Front-End Project

Each member of your group is required to submit the following for review:

1. The URL of the deployed application.
2. The URL of the GitHub repository, with a unique name and a README describing the project.

### Prepare for Next Week

In the next module, you'll continue to work on your group projects. You'll end the week by presenting your project to your class. Once your project is

 complete, you'll want to update your professional materials and add your new project to your portfolio!

# *Pseudo Code*

GROUP PROJECT

This pseudocode was completed in collaboration.
Collaborators: Kapil, Ishmam and Dairon.
Date: 19th Sept 2023.

```javascript
Important to take the time to consider how the website will work from multiple perspectives.
How will the user interact with the website, what do they need to see, understand and what do we expect them to do.
Then with that understanding, what do I as a Front End developer need to complete on a high level, in order to achieve that.
Subsequently, what programming tools, concepts, functions etc. do I need to use to achieve that, and can I start coding out a bit under each point.
I can review the past week(s) material to get a clue on how to code the initial bits.

````

## USER VIEW OF PAGE
- consider how the images show up on the cards, and if we will use all the same cards. Or a mixture of top/mid/bottom.
- what color scheme are we going for in terms of the look and feel of the website?
-<b><i> What is this project's user story? and acceptance criteria</b></i>
- When the user accesses the website they will see different elements on the page. How much will be seen initially on the page?#
- Overall the webpage will have:
1. Navbar (Homepage|Contact us | Jumbotron/ Main Heading)
2. Bootstrap cards (Disabling cards once a user has selected them)
3. Footer contact
4. Images
5. what color scheme should we implement, and why?
   
- <b><u>(OUTPUTs from this stage: wireframe(s) of the website to be built, with relevant elements incorporated e.g. color, size of items on display etc.)</b></u>

## DEVELOPER TASKS

- ensure that website works on different screen sizes (media query)
- how does the styling of the design look like once you change size of the webpage.
- Test if user presses back rather then using the button or copies the initial link, where does it take them)
- read the bootstrap documentation, the google api documentation and the wikipedia documentation
- create repository, with initial files and folder structure
- ensure that required script links are in html to script.js and style.css, reset.css
- we need to use gitignore to hide the api keys, and create accounts for both APIs google and wikipedia
- the api keys go into the config.js file.
- we need to build either 1 page with multi lines of code, or up to 9 pages 
- is it useful to have a timer on the link
-  Counter to keep track of how many card you have left
-  Once a user refreshed the page, the card is either hidden or disabled and moved to the bottom of the lsit. Whilst the unseen cards come to the top)
-  
````javascript
(OUTPUT stage 2: logic behind all the elements needed)
````

## FUNCTIONs,TOOLS etc NEEDED TO EXECUTE

(OUPUT stage 3: build the html, javascript, asset folder etc., review online documents, code and test along the way. Remember to commit each time you have working code. Make use of alert, confirm, prompt and console.log when testing but change to show elements on the page.)
