## Overview

Welcome to our group project! <b><i><span style="color:#800020">Landmark Learning </span></b></i>  is an Interactive Front-End Application, it's important for us as front-end web developers to be able to showcase our skills and knowledge. 

The project team has used the skills and knowledge acquired during the bootcamp to build this web application from scratch. Our team has conceived and executed a design of a MVP of our project.

<b><i><span style="color:#800020">Landmark Learning </span></b></i> solves a real-world problem by integrating data received from multiple server-side API requests.

In this project several technologies are used to bring a feature rich and exciting web project to life! As a project team we thought about what would be a interesting way to guide users into exploring the world a bit more. After a few [PROJET IDEAS](./assets/PROJECT%20IDEAS.md) were brainstormed, we choose to implement two server side api's. Google's [Aerial View API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/aerial-view) and Wikipedia's [Wikimedia API](https://api.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) to render a dynamic, responsive and interactive project.

```
USER STORY

As a user interested in exploring landmarks around the world, I want to use the Landmark Learning Dashboard to access information about various landmarks and view aerial videos of these landmarks. This will allow me to expand my knowledge about different places and have a visually engaging experience.

### Project Objectives

By the end of this project, we have been be able to:

- Our ability to speak technically about the features that were implemented in our project.
- Explain and execute git branching workflow in a collaborative project.
- Resolve merge conflicts.
- Explain agile software development.
- Design, build, and deploy a client-side web application using GitHub Pages.
- Prepare a professional presentation and repository README for our project.


## Deployment

The Landmark Learning Dashboard Project is deployed at the following live URL:

[Landmark Learning Dashboard](https://daironreijna.github.io/Landmark-Learning-API)

The GitHub repository for this project can be found at:

[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/daironreijna/Landmark-Learning-API)

<br>
<u>In order to use this webapp, you will need to </u>

1. Create your own API key by visiting https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/aerial-view/get-api-key 
2. Create a config.js file in the asset/js folder
3. Save the API key in the below format

<b>Example:</b> 

````javascript
var config = {
	googleAPIKEY: [YOUR_SECRET_API_KEY_GOES_HERE],
    wikipediaAPIKEY: [YOUR_SECRET_API_KEY_GOES_HERE]
};
````
````javascript
// ===== after placing your API key ===========
var config = {
	googleAPIKEY: "14c5e5e260e3e3432d141deb7d150ec3",
    wikipediaAPIKEY: "eb7d150ec314c5e5e260e3e3432d141d"
};
````

### Project Features
Our project has the following features:

- Application uses at least two server-side APIs.
